          <p>My name is Florence. I have four children. Iâ€™ve always believed that life is about supporting each other because if we take care of one another, everyone grows. I want to see my daughter grow up to be empowered just like me. Here at Tribearth, I have found peace and happiness in the work I do and I see a hopeful future ahead.</p>
